# Create Product Requirements Document

Use the **prd skill** to create a PRD for: $ARGUMENTS

Follow the instructions in the prd skill (`.claude/skills/prd/SKILL.md`) to:

1. Ask 3-5 clarifying questions with lettered options
2. Generate a structured PRD based on answers
3. Save to `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`

**Important:** Do NOT start implementing. Just create the PRD.
